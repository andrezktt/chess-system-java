# Chess System Java

![Chess Game Screenshot](link-to-image)

## Description (English)

This project is a chess system developed in Java as part of a deeper learning experience in object-oriented programming and design principles. The goal of the project is to simulate a playable chess game directly in the console, with all the features of a classic game, including piece movement, check, and checkmate detection.

### Features

- Full movement of pieces (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn)
- Check and checkmate detection
- Validation of legal moves according to the official chess rules
- Turn-based system between two players
- Updated board display after each move
- Capturing opponent's pieces
- Pawn promotion system
- Implemented in Java with a focus on OOP

### Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrezktt/chess-system-java.git
   ```

2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.

3. Run the `Program.java` file, which contains the main method to start the game.

4. Follow the console instructions to move the pieces. Each move should be entered in the format `e2 e4`, where `e2` is the starting position and `e4` is the destination position.

### Game Example

```bash
Turn: White
Current position: e2
Target position: e4

Turn: Black
Current position: e7
Target position: e5

...

Checkmate! White wins!
```

### Future Plans

- Graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visual
- Implementation of AI for playing against a computer opponent
- Save and load game functionality
- Undo move system
